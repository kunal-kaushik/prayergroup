            Welcome to the Rosary Prayer Group of{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">Flames of Love</span>, a spiritual
            community inspired by the Blessed Virgin Mary and rooted in the rich
            traditions of our Roman Catholic faith.

            Our Beginnings: A Journey of Faith and Devotion
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our prayer group began as a humble inspiration, born in the hearts
            of two young, devout Catholic women who frequented the Fatima Shrine
            in New Jersey. Immersed in prayer and devotion, they encountered the
            profound beauty of the{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">Flames of Love</span> movement, a
            Marian initiative that seeks to spread the light of Christ and
            deepen devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. This movement
            emphasizes the power of the rosary in blinding Satan and opening
            hearts to the transforming love of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, they believed such a group was meant only for those in
            holy orders, particularly Carmelites living in monasteries. However,
            through reading the book{" "}
            <span className="italic">&quot;Her Glorious Title&quot;</span> by{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">John M. Haffert</span>, they
            discovered a beautiful truth: by wearing the{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">Brown Scapular</span> and praying
            the rosary daily, any layperson becomes spiritually connected to the
            Carmelite order. Empowered by this revelation, they realized they
            were called to bring this devotion to life outside the walls of a
            monastery.
          </p>

            A Divine Inspiration
          </h2>
          <p>
            During a Mass, one of these women felt a deep, personal call from
            Our Lady to start a rosary group. While she humbly refrains from
            describing this moment as a mystical experience, it was a profound
            sense of inspiration that affirmed their shared desire to establish
            a prayer group dedicated to the Holy Rosary. Around the same time,
            the other founding woman, while adoring Christ during Eucharistic
            Adoration, felt in her heart that it was the will of Christ for her
            to begin a rosary prayer group. This shared calling, rooted in
            devotion to both Our Lady and Christ, became the foundation of their
            mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, another woman in their parish had a similar
            spiritual prompting to start a rosary group. Recognizing the hand of
            God in their shared calling, the three women united their efforts
            and formally established the Rosary Prayer Group, dedicating it to
            the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of{" "}

          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our mission is simple yet profound: to honor the Immaculate Heart of
            Mary by praying the Holy Rosary and the Divine Mercy Chaplet,
            offering our prayers for the conversion of sinners, the
            sanctification of the world, and the triumph of Christ&apos;s love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through prayer, we seek to grow in holiness, foster a deeper
            relationship with Jesus Christ, and intercede for the needs of the
            Church and the world. We strive to be a community of faith, hope,
            and love, united in devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.
          </p>
